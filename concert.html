	<h1>Playing a concert</h1>
	<p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time!</p>
	<p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts!</p>
	<h2>Copy out a set-list</h2>
	<p>A <strong>set-list </strong>is a of all your songs in the order you'll play them.</p>
	<p>Print copies for everyone</p>
	<p>Print it <strong>BIG!</strong> So that you  can still read it if it's down by your feet on the floor or if the lighting isn't very good</p>
	<h2>Remember your spares</h2>
	<p>Some instruments have parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Guitar Strings</li>
	<li>saxophone or clarinet reeds</li>
	<li>Drumsticks</li>
	</ul>
<p>Make a list of spares you might need and make sure you know where they are in an emergency.</p>
<h2>Plan where you'll be on the stage</h2>
<p>Before you start to set up your instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the drums be center stage? Or off to one side?</li>
<li>Is there a power-socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands on the right?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your instruments. it's really annoying if you have to start unplugging things and swapping places once you've begun to set things up! </p>
<h2>You know where you're going, know when your on</h2>
<p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Print out a map or set the sat nav before you set out. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unfimiliar place half-an-hour before you're due to go on-stage</p>
<p>And when you arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time ou're on </strong>. On the night times often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Dont get cought!</p>
